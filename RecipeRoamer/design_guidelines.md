# Smart Automation Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Selected Approach**: Design System Approach using Material Design
**Justification**: This is a utility-focused, data-heavy enterprise application where efficiency and usability are paramount. Material Design provides excellent patterns for data visualization, forms, and information hierarchy.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Light mode: 25 85% 53% (Corporate blue)
- Dark mode: 215 20% 15% (Dark blue-grey background)

**Supporting Colors:**
- Success: 120 60% 50% (Forest green for positive metrics)
- Warning: 45 90% 55% (Amber for alerts)
- Error: 0 70% 50% (Red for critical issues)
- Neutral: 220 15% 25% (Charcoal grey for text)

### B. Typography
**Font Families**: Inter (primary), Roboto Mono (data/numbers)
**Hierarchy:**
- H1: 32px, Bold - Page titles
- H2: 24px, Semibold - Section headers
- H3: 18px, Medium - Subsections
- Body: 16px, Regular - Main content
- Caption: 14px, Regular - Labels and metadata

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Tailwind units of 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Micro spacing: p-2, m-2 (8px)
- Standard spacing: p-4, m-4 (16px) 
- Section spacing: p-6, m-6 (24px)
- Large spacing: p-8, m-8 (32px)

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Top navigation bar with POWERGRID branding
- Sidebar navigation for main modules (Data Input, Forecasting, Analysis, Reports)
- Breadcrumb navigation for multi-step processes

**Forms:**
- Material Design input fields with floating labels
- Grouped form sections with clear visual separation
- File upload areas with drag-and-drop functionality
- Multi-step form wizard for complex data entry

**Data Displays:**
- Card-based layout for key metrics and KPIs
- Data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Interactive charts using Chart.js or D3.js
- Timeline visualizations for project schedules

**Overlays:**
- Modal dialogs for detailed views and confirmations
- Toast notifications for system feedback
- Loading states with progress indicators

### E. Animations
**Minimal Implementation:**
- Subtle fade-ins for data loading (200ms)
- Smooth transitions for chart updates (300ms)
- No decorative animations

## Images
No large hero image required. This is a utility-focused application that should prioritize data and functionality over visual marketing elements. Consider small icons and illustrations for:
- Empty states in data tables
- Loading placeholders
- Error state illustrations
- Small iconography for material types and project categories

The visual focus should remain on charts, graphs, and data visualizations rather than decorative imagery.
